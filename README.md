<h1>Fragmented Text to QR/FragmentQR</h1><p>
<em>Yonah Aviv</em>
<b>Fragmented Text to QR also known as FragmentQR, is a web extension that allows for the generation of QR codes linking to arbituary text on a webpage, making use of Text Fragments</b>

<h2>Tutorial</h2><p>
1. Select text<p>
2. Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L to copy the Text Fragment. Wait for your selection to be highlighted in yellow(may only works on HTTPS, if an error dialogue appears follow the instructions)<p>
3. Use Ctrl/Cmd+Q to open the extension popup<p>
4. Click the paste button<p>
  If steps 1 or 2 do not work, go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts to reconfigure the shortcuts<p>

Once you have created a QR code for your Text Fragment using FragmentQR, which you can scan using a QR code scanner such as Google Lens or your default camera app, make sure to open the link in Goog. Works in most Chromium 80+ based browsers(Go to the description in the youtube video for more on browser compatibility).<p>
